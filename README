Quick notes on meta-mion-sde.

This layer requires you to have in ${MIONBASE} a directory named bf-sde.

Within bf-sde should be the following:

bf-reference-bsp-9.3.0-<MACHINE>.zip
bf-reference-bsp-9.3.0.tgz
bf-sde-9.3.0.tgz

Once these are added to the directory you should:

cd bf-sde
git init
git add .
git commit -s -m"Adding reference bsp and sde"

Eventually we'll use externalsrc, but for now this was easiest for
me to get working.
