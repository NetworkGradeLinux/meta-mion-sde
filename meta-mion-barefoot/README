In order to use the meta-mion-sde/meta-mion-barefoot layer you must have the
barefoot reference bsp in a zip file located in MIONBASE/bf-sde and the barefoot
sde (9.2.0) in tgz format in MIONBASE/bf-sde. You should then git init and git add .
and git commit all files in that directory.

This is just for the P4 POC and will change.

~/mion/bf-sde$ ls -al
total 402624
drwxrwxr-x  3 pidge pidge      4096 Feb  9 09:38 .
drwxrwxr-x 19 pidge pidge      4096 Feb 18 16:31 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 pidge pidge   1992512 Jan 25 11:05 bf-reference-bsp-9.2.0-BF2556-main.zip

drwxrwxr-x  8 pidge pidge      4096 Feb  9 09:37 .git

In order to add the SDE to your image, add IMAGE_INSTALL += "packagegroup-sde-barefoot"
to your local.conf

A reference p4 program called p4helloworld is in meta-mion-barefoot/recipes-extended.
Adding this to the image will allow you to compile the program locally and pack it into
the image. Eventually, we'll also allow this to be flashed to the tofino on boot (not
supported in POC)
